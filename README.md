# Movie Data Project - Harry Webber

## Project Description
As part of the Data analysis pathway on the Digital Futures training academy, we were asked to create a Jupyter Notebook file which explored the given dataset and drew analytical insights.
The overall project was assessed based on the Notebook file and a presentation given to a Digital Futures staff member (in the style of an informal conversation with a line manager).

## Project Requirements
Requirements for the project were as follows...
* Minimum of 3 Python visualisations showcasing insights drawn from the data.
* 2 keypoints drawn from the data - explicitly stated in Markdown format and explained by your code & findings.
* Select 2 movies on which to provide a more in-depth single observation analysis.

## Additional Information
This was a single day project for which the presentation was due first thing on the next morning.

## Personal Context
At time of project completion, I had only been working with the pandas data analysis library for Python for about a week.
This project was really fun to practice some of the things that we had already learned - and by the end, I was keen to practice and develop the skills further.
